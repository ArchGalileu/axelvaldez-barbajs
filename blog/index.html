This blog is just a collection of notes that I want to save and share, and stuff I keep thinking about. If something resonates with you, <a href="https://twitter.com/axel">ping me on Twitter</a> and let's talk about it!

<ul class="postlist">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <span class="date">{{ post.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}</span>
    <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
