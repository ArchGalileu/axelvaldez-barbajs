I’ve never been great at illustration.  My strong skills in design are UI and front-end code (which I think is also design, btw). Still, I’ve made several illustrations for Nearsoft in the last couple of years, and that’s given me an itch to get better at it.

Last week I took [Ryan Putnam’s](http://ryanputn.am) class "[Design your Avatar](http://skl.sh/2tCFflF)". I went into the videos with low expectations, not because of Putnam (he's great), but because of lousy experiences I've had with Skillshare in the past. This being said, the mastery and simplicity Putnam shows in his process made it a great learning experience. I recommend you go and take the class right now.

Two days after watching the class I learned about a contest Sticker Mule was running over Dribbble: to design a sticker under the theme “UK”.

I decided to draw one of the first things that come to my mind when I think of the UK: Morrissey (the other things are The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Pulp). I took the learnings from Putnam’s class for a run, and this is the result:

It’s not the best Morrissey out there, but it shortens [the gap](http://writerunderground.com/2011/04/28/ira-glass-on-creativity-or-the-gap-between-our-taste-and-our-work/) between my taste and my skill, and because of that, I’m damn proud of it. It made me want to do more and it got me 20 bucks for stickers, and in my world money for stickers is always welcomed.
