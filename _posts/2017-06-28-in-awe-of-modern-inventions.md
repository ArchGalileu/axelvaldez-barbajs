Before photography was invented, people could only see that in front of their eyes. To experience the rest of the world, people had to physically travel, or, if they couldn’t afford it, to use other people’s interpretation of these remote places via narrative or painting.

That’s why the invention of photography was so huge for the human race. It removed a limit that most people didn’t even thought was there, and opened a lot of possibilities to experience the physical world we live in.

I remember in the 1980s, people saying everything important was already invented. Now we know that idea is completely wrong, but we replaced it
with a big attitude of cynicism to every new invention and technology in general.

We now have cars that drive themselves, and we aren’t  excited at all!

These are two (now) very basic inventions during my lifetime that changed me forever:

## The Internet
One of the first things that blew my mind when I first experienced the internet back in the 1990s wasn’t the web, or email, but the possibility of connecting with random people all around the world.

I remember chatting with people from Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, Philippines, Malaysia, Spain. I, who at the time hadn’t traveled more than 500km from my hometown, was in real awe, even when the conversations never went beyond superficial subjects from “how’s your house/street/city” to “what kind of music do you listen to?”.

## Google Earth
The first time I used Google Earth, I felt a mix of excitement with something very similar to fear. It was awe again. I went all around the world seeing aerial views of famous locations, then known cities, then my house, my relatives houses, my school. In every single step I took, I expected the experience to fail, but every single time, the experience delivered.

When photos were invented, we still needed a photographer to go to every place we wanted to see, and take a picture. With the internet chatrooms, the availability was limited to people who actively logged in to the same chat room we were in, but with Google Earth, everything was there. Why would my grandma’s house be on the internet? Or mine? Or my school? Just because. Just. Because.

Months after that, Google started adding maps, street photos, directions, etc., on top of Google Earth. Stuff that made the tool practical for everyday use. But at first, Google Earth simply removed a limit we didn’t knew we had. And that was, again, awesome.
